## Methodology

This analysis combines Bitcoin market sentiment data (Fear/Greed classification) with historical trader-level execution data from Hyperliquid.  
Both datasets were cleaned, timestamps were converted to a daily level, and records were aligned by date.

Key metrics were engineered to evaluate trader behavior and performance, including:
- Daily closed PnL per trader
- Win rate (percentage of profitable trades)
- Trade frequency per day
- Trade size (USD) as a proxy for exposure
- Long/short trade ratio

Since explicit leverage values were not available, trade size in USD was used as an exposure proxy.  
Traders were segmented into behavioral groups (high vs low exposure, frequent vs infrequent traders) to identify differential responses to market sentiment.

Visual analysis (boxplots and bar charts) and aggregated statistics were used to compare performance and behavior across Fear and Greed regimes.

## Key Insights

1. **Performance differs significantly by sentiment**  
   Trader PnL shows higher volatility during Greed periods, indicating increased risk-taking. Fear periods exhibit more stable but lower overall returns.

2. **Behavior shifts under Fear sentiment**  
   During Fear days, traders reduce trade frequency and average trade size, reflecting a risk-off approach.

3. **High exposure traders are more vulnerable during Fear periods**  
   Traders with larger position sizes experience disproportionately worse outcomes on Fear days, suggesting weaker risk management under adverse sentiment.

## Strategy Recommendations

1. **Risk Management Rule**  
   During Fear sentiment days, traders should reduce exposure (position size) and avoid aggressive trading strategies, especially if they historically fall into the high-exposure segment.

2. **Selective Aggression Rule**  
   During Greed sentiment periods, increased trade frequency should be limited to frequent traders with a history of consistent profitability, while less consistent traders should cap risk to avoid drawdowns.
